Debugging
=========

Aya has built-in support for setting breakpoints using the ``bp``
command. For example:

::

   {a b : c,
       a b + :c;
       [a b]
       bp
       c J
   }:fn;

Calling this function with pause execution at the location of ``bp`` and
open a shell for inspection.

::

   aya> 1 2 fn
   Execution paused, enter '.' to continue
   Stack: [ 1 2 ] 
   Next instructions:   c J

   aya (debug)> a
   1 

   aya (debug)> c
   3 

   aya (debug)> .
   [ 1 2 3 ] 

Setting ``__aya__.ignore_breakpoints`` to ``1`` will disable breakpoints
in the session and setting it to ``0`` will enable them. It is set to
``0`` by default.

::

   aya> 1 __aya__.:ignore_breakpoints;

   aya> 1 2 fn
   [ 1 2 3 ] 

   aya> 0 __aya__.:ignore_breakpoints;

   aya> 1 2 fn
   Execution paused, enter '.' to continue
   ...
